Kubescape is the first open-source tool for testing if Kubernetes is deployed securely according to multiple frameworks
regulatory, customized company policies and DevSecOps best practices, such as
the  [NSA-CISA](https://www.armosec.io/blog/kubernetes-hardening-guidance-summary-by-armo) and
the [MITRE ATT&CKÂ®](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/23/secure-containerized-environments-with-updated-threat-matrix-for-kubernetes/)
. Kubescape scans K8s clusters, YAML files, and HELM charts, and detect misconfigurations and software vulnerabilities
at early stages of the CI/CD pipeline and provides a risk score instantly and risk trends over time. Kubescape
integrates natively with other DevOps tools, including Jenkins, CircleCI and Github workflows.
